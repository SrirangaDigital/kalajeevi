     <p>Bendre, as is well-known, is a magician of words; and in most of his poems we find alliteration and assonance automatically joining the flow of his words. Many poems of Bendre, such as "Gangavatarana", "Hakki Harutide," and "Belagu" have been adversely critiqued by some major Kannada Critics on the grounds of `use of words only for alliteration' and `mixed metaphors.' Jeevi takes up such poems for re-valuation and explicates them in details, drawing our attention to the myths, concepts of Yoga, and varied rituals alluded to in the poem. According to Jeevi, no single reading can completely understand Bendre's poems since they demand from the readers a knowledge of Indian myths, Sanskrit and Kannada poetical traditions, and the science of numerology.</p>
     <p>"Maitriyoga," Jeevi points out, contains 63 poems by Bendre on his friends and fellow writers, mostly the members of the famous `Geleyara Gumpu' in Dharwad, When these poems were written, Bendre was the first poet to write on so many literary figures in Kannada, including Madhurachanna, Gokak, Mugali, Siddavanahalli, and such, However, some of the poems are on younger writers also like Kodagina Gowramma and Janakamma. In a lyrical vein, all those poems register the kind of affectionate relationship Bendre had with them. As Jeevi points out, these poems can be viewed as a `literary history' of Kannada, at a particular period (1920-1940). </p>
     <p>Throughout the book are scattered very interesting incidents related to Bendre. One such is related to Bendre's knowledge of numerology. Once, in 1981, when Bendre was in a hospital, it seems a nurse told him that all of his admirers were looking forward to an epic from him. Bendre told her that he had already written one and its message was 881 and 441. When the nurse looked at him perplexe, it seems, Bendre continued that 881 and 441 symbolised heart and knowlege and that through their intercation the New Man would come into existencem and that was the theme of his epic.</p>
     <p>To put it briefly, Jeevi's book is a `Reader's Guide' to Bendre and his poetry.</p>
